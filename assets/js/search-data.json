            "content": "LUNA Stability . Crypto market is believed to be volatile compared to most of the well known financial instruments. Although the returns are high, many of the high net worth investors and institutional investors are bit hesitant to enter the market due to that risk. However, it&#39;s been quite clear that since late even those institutional investors with low risk apetite has also started investing in crypto currencies specially in Bitcoin. As the oldest and the first crypto currency, Bitcoin still maintains the number one crypto asset in terms of market cap and potentially the familiarity and popularity among the general public. . Terra started making headlines in crypto world with the goal of making algorthmic decentralized stable coins. LUNA is the life blood of Terra eco system which acts as The Terra protocol’s native staking token that absorbs the price volatility of Terra. Luna is used for governance and in mining. Users stake Luna to validators who record and verify transactions on the blockchain in exchange for rewards from transaction fees. The more Terra is used, the more Luna is worth. . In order to understand how stable LUNA is, We will compare it with BTC first and then ETH, and ADA, the reason is BTC is the coin that anybody would like to compare against, ETH is the second largest market cap coin while it&#39;s also the first coin with smart contracts, while ADA is a coin with a similar market cap of LUNA while older than LUNA. So in comparing one to another in the worst market times we will be looking at the price volatility of these underlying assets. first compare LUNA with BTC price volatility since the beginning of 2021, and we will then be look at all the 4 assets mentioned above during the recent market down turn. . Price change percentages . First We have hourly price changes of LUNA and BTC thanks to flipside crypto and yahoo finance. Let&#39;s look at BTC and LUNA price change percentage over 24 hour rolling average since the beginning of 2021. . Now it&#39;s evident that BTC had days with more than 2% change in 24 hour moving averages in to the downside than LUNA while LUNA sees more fluctuation in price both down and up wards than BTC. . First Let&#39;s do the same comparison with ETH and ADA... . Just by looking at the charts we can guess that ADA was more volatile in price while ETH was slightly better performing than LUNA, but was that true? let&#39;s look at the standard deviation on a 24 hour rolling basis to get a different view. . What is moving standard deviation . Moving Standard Deviation is a statistical measurement of market volatility. It makes no predictions of market direction, but it may serve as a confirming indicator. You specify the number of periods to use, and the study computes the standard deviation of prices from the moving average of the prices. . Standard Deviation values rise significantly when the analyzed contract of indicator change in value dramatically. When markets are stable, low Standard Deviation readings are normal. . In the following graph we will be comparing 24 hour rolling standard deviation of the 4 assets mentioned above. The size of the data point represents the price of the underlying assts. bigger the point higher the price. . It looks like LUNA had it&#39;s fair share of volatility specially when the price was low and with price getting higher and higher it&#39;s volatility has been reduced somewhat. Now how can we quantify this and compare the volatility in a better way. . Hourly Daily Annual . BTC 0.17935 | 0.87861 | 16.79153 | . LUNA 1.61820 | 7.92752 | 151.50690 | . ETH 0.22908 | 1.12224 | 21.44778 | . ADA 0.27858 | 1.36478 | 26.08300 | . &lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; height=&quot;24px&quot;viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; width=&quot;24px&quot;&gt; &lt;/svg&gt; This is the daily, weekly and annualized volatility for the 4 assets we were comparing. Now these numbers are for data from the beginning of 2021 although this shows LUNA was highly volatile compared to other assets we know the price of the LUNA was also changed 127X during the time period. We&#39;ll look at how these 4 assets performed suring the recent market downturn in early 2022 but before that let&#39;s try to get an intuition of this volatility bit further. for that we will be using a GARCH model . What is a GARCH model. . Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) is a statistical model used in analyzing time-series data where the variance error is believed to be serially autocorrelated. GARCH models assume that the variance of the error term follows an autoregressive moving average process. . which means it suited for: . predicting the volatility of returns on financial assets. | assessing risk and expected returns for assets that exhibit clustered periods of volatility in returns. | . LUNA ETH BTC ADA . mu 0.02505 | 0.03036 | 0.01295 | -0.03378 | . omega 0.08298 | 0.03130 | 0.07397 | 0.04282 | . alpha[1] 0.14766 | 0.11922 | 0.28779 | 0.09479 | . beta[1] 0.83199 | 0.85102 | 0.62388 | 0.90521 | . &lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; height=&quot;24px&quot;viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; width=&quot;24px&quot;&gt; &lt;/svg&gt; No how can we interpret this: . Alpha (ARCH term) represents how volatility reacts to new information(small alpha=small impact of innovation) Beta (GARCH Term) represents persistence of the volatility Alpha + Beta shows overall measurement of persistence of volatility. in each case we obtained a model with small alpha and high beta. Alpha catches the effect of innovations on future volatility, while (alpha+beta) - how long the effect persist (or how fast it decays over time). In each of these models alpha+beta is high, so the effect decays slowly. . So what we can say about the 4 assets? . LUNA&#39;s volatility is the most impacted in short term while it&#39;s volatility persistent is the lowest on the other hand BTC&#39;s sudden volatility impact is lowest compared to other 3 but the persistence of the volatility is highest among all. . ETH LUNA BTC ADA . 0 295.92115 | 13675.37833 | 49.16989 | 430.91460 | . &lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; height=&quot;24px&quot;viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; width=&quot;24px&quot;&gt; &lt;/svg&gt; But as we can see LUNA has gained 12606% in price since 2021 which is significantly higher than the other two. One can argue that the other assets have been in the market for a long time than LUNA and since LUNA was relatively young it had the chance to appreciate in price rapidly. However the point is LUNAs volatility came with huge appreciation in price... !!! . Now let&#39;s look at what happened in early 2022 . Previously, we looked at the data from the beginning of 2021 which of course shows the bigger picture but let&#39;s look at a time when a market down turn happened. On the other hand LUNA adopt more users in 2021 so, it became one of the &quot;blue chip&quot; assets very recently, getting in to top 10 in terms of market cap. therefore it would be fair to compare other assets with LUNA in 2022 rather than in 2021. . We can see LUNA has high volatile days in 2022 compared to others but in terms of price it seems to have appreciated specially in the latter part of February while early January had seen some price depreciation though the volatility wasn&#39;t significantly higher than the other 3 assets. (the size of the points represents the price) . LUNA ETH BTC ADA . mu 0.01907 | 0.03259 | 0.04419 | -0.00404 | . omega 0.03919 | 0.13497 | 0.08001 | 0.01529 | . alpha[1] 0.08771 | 0.33202 | 0.67515 | 0.04190 | . beta[1] 0.88844 | 0.52006 | 0.32485 | 0.94673 | . &lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; height=&quot;24px&quot;viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; width=&quot;24px&quot;&gt; &lt;/svg&gt; ETH LUNA BTC ADA . 0 -21.45311 | 4.69122 | -7.23561 | -27.98558 | . &lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; height=&quot;24px&quot;viewBox=&quot;0 0 24 24&quot; width=&quot;24px&quot;&gt; &lt;/svg&gt; Again we can see in 2022 LUNA&#39;s price difference was relatively better compared to other assets although it was volatile in both directions. we can look at a histogram to confrim that the daily volatility frequencies. . To Conclude: . LUNA has it&#39;s high volatility nature in both directions | But LUNA seems to have rewarded it&#39;s holders better as the price of the LUNA appreciated highly since 2021 and impacted the least in 2022 (among the 4 assets we compared) | .",

            "content": "What are Centralized Exchanges(CEX) . Broadly speaking, there are two categories of crypto exchanges: centralized exchanges(CEX) and decentralized exchanges(DEX). Each category comes with its own advantages and disadvantages. Centralized crypto exchanges (CEX) are managed by one organization. Centralized exchanges make it easy to get started with cryptocurrency trading by allowing users to convert their fiat currency, like US dollars, directly into crypto. The vast majority of crypto trading take place on centralized exchanges. The company or organization may require users to follow Know Your Customer (KYC) rules. These require each user to provide proof of their identity, much as you would when you apply for a bank account. There are few concern with centralized exchanges, the private key to the wallet that contains user&#39;s coins and tokens will be under that company or organization custody which is open to hacking, privacy issues and also regulatory issues. As crypto fans say &#39;Not your Keys, Not your Coins&#39; . Alright let&#39;s see how Algorand users interacted with Centralized Exchanges since the beginning of 2021 . The date of analysis: 2022-Feb-20 Based on data curated and freely distributed by flipsidecrypto. . Let&#39;s look at how ALGOs flown in to CEX from user wallets (Deposits) . Users have chosen 29 different Centralized Exchanges to send ALGOs from their wallets(Deposited to CEX). . The above chart visualizes how much Algo deposited to Centralized exchanges while the size of the circle represents number of wallets that sends those Algos, the bigger the circle size, higher the numebr of users. . It&#39;s evident that Binance has been their favorite CEX for Algo users to deposit their Algos since the beginning of 2021, in terms of both the volume of Algos and number of senders by quite a big margin. . from_cex_api_url = &#39;https://api.flipsidecrypto.com/api/v2/queries/b85708b3-8e0c-4cc2-9b81-041df3aa400c/data/latest&#39; .",
